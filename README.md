# PHPTSD

A nightmarish PHP library

------

* Familiar working with events? Add some pain into your workflow with a `TraumaticEvent` class
* Unhandled `TraumaticEvent` items do not support a max-retry limit and will always go straight back into the queue
* Sprinkle some unpredictability into accessing objects in memory
* Augment your current state with related past events
* Experience random freezes
* Decouple your core logic by making use of the Dissociative Protection layer
* The `Dissonance` helper makes sure that `true === false`; useful for debugging the causes of issues!

Please remember to always Git Blame Yourself
